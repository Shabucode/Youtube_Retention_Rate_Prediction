0,,,"Embarrassingly Dumb Ways People Died - Darwin Awards Winners [Part 6] For most of us, the natural instinct to survive is"
1,,,"pretty effective at keeping us from serious harm. But for some people, the impulse to carry out acts of sheer, unbelievable"
2,,,"stupidity somehow overwhelms the rational mind’s urge to survive. Without further ado, get ready to be baffled by these people who"
3,,,"became real-life examples of natural selection in action. Quick Eggs-It As far as humanity’s greatest intellectuals are concerned, it’s fair to"
4,,,"assume none of them have been regular participants in eating contests. But while the whole concept is pretty dumb, one Indian"
5,,,man learned in 2019 that it can also be fatal. After a disagreement took place between the man and his friend
6,80.63,55.6,"in a marketplace in India’s Jaunpur district, they decided there was only one way to settle it. An egg-eating contest. With"
7,80.08,53.96,"a $30 bet on the table for whoever could eat 50 the fastest, the men began scoffing hard-boiled eggs. But while"
8,79.64,53.03,"devouring his 42nd egg, one of the eaters collapsed and fell unconscious, and died soon afterwards in hospital. His body couldn’t"
9,79.23,52.96,"deal with the dense load of 42 eggs, which could’ve weighed as much as 6lbs. So remember: if you want a"
10,78.5,54.02,"really filling breakfast that won’t kill you, don’t exceed 41 eggs. Bird-Brained Idea Another case of eggs-gone-wrong occurred back in 2006,"
11,77.97,56.98,"in Doncaster, England. A man, who had a string of convictions for stealing rare, protected bird eggs, was on the hunt"
12,77.29,62.03,"for illicit eggs in a local forest. Spotting what he presumed to be a sparrow hawk’s nest, the 62-year-old began climbing"
13,77.08,67.21,"the branches of a tree in hope of something valuable. As he approached the top, however, an avoidable disaster struck. You"
14,82.21,69.36,"see, this bird-egg bandit had long-standing issues with high blood pressure, which often led to dizzy spells and fainting. Why he’d"
15,76.6,66.86,"choose a career that involved climbing up precarious tree branches, while battling a tendency to randomly pass out, is anyone’s guess."
16,76.18,61.15,"But it doesn’t take too much guessing to figure out what happened. At the top of the tree, he passed out,"
17,75.08,55.42,"plummeting to the ground, breaking his ribs and having his heart punctured by branches on the way down. Karma was clearly"
18,75.74,51.24,"on the birds’ side, because the egg thief died soon afterwards. Connection Issues The reason grappling down the sides of buildings"
19,73.9,47.84,"is possible in movies is that the characters typically use state-of-the-art equipment that they know they can rely on. Sadly, a"
20,73.64,44.56,"47-year-old man from Northern France seemed to miss this important qualifying factor in 2017, when he attempted his own Mission Impossible-style"
21,73.37,41.56,"escape. The man had been locked up in his room by his mother to try to control his hard-drinking lifestyle, so"
22,72.95,39.15,he hatched an escape plan. The grounded 47-year-old decided that rappelling down from the 9th-story apartment window would be the best
23,72.38,37.49,"way out. Unfortunately, he didn’t have any heavy-duty steel wire available, and opted to use a simple ethernet cable instead. It’s"
24,71.73,36.62,"unclear what he tried to attach it to, but the makeshift abseiling equipment snapped almost instantly, and he plummeted to the"
25,71.53,36.27,"pavement below. His mother’s plan worked: he never drank again. Heat Treatment In 2019, in Bengaluru, India, an act of lethal"
26,71.15,35.96,stupidity brought one man’s life to a rather heated end. While cleaning out a chimney at his home using petrol-fuelled cleaning
27,70.73,35.49,"equipment, the irresistible call of nicotine came a-knockin’. Disregarding the common-sense warnings against using naked flames near petrol-fuelled machines, he pulled"
28,70.45,35.28,"out his lighter to spark up a cigarette. Unfortunately, in the process of loading up the cleaning equipment, he’d accidentally doused"
29,70.22,35.85,"himself in a considerable amount of petrol. The moment he lit his cigarette, his clothes went up in flames, and within"
30,69.8,36.94,"minutes, he’d burnt to death. Not only did he die a totally avoidable, agonizing death; the smoke he released probably undid"
31,70.51,37.47,"a fair chunk of his cleaning work too! Blocked Up The obesity epidemic is a very modern problem, arising from our"
32,68.91,36.62,species’ transition into the double-edged sword of having a constant abundance of food. But while heart disease and diabetes are typical
33,68.76,34.54,"thoroughfare for the obese, one woman’s excessive weight presented an additional fatal issue: one of logistics. When the 30-stone woman, from"
34,68.57,31.98,"Dorset, England, went into cardiac arrest in January 2016, the medics who arrived were presented with a unique predicament. Because of"
35,68.0,29.65,"her weight, it was almost impossible to lug her outside to the emergency vehicles. A long series of proposed solutions ensued,"
36,67.48,28.14,"including a suggestion that firefighters remove a window to hoist her down, but before something could be decided, it was too"
37,67.28,28.01,"late. Thanks to the unexpected obstacles and delays her obesity caused, the woman died an otherwise-preventable death before she could reach"
38,66.47,29.47,"a hospital. Unhappy Accidents We’ve all claimed to be ‘dying from embarrassment’ at some point, after a particularly humiliating event in"
39,66.44,32.08,"the public eye. But tripping in the school corridor, or accidentally farting on a first date, usually doesn’t prove fatal in"
40,66.38,34.75,"a literal sense. For one 69-year-old Florida man, though, a supremely embarrassing episode in 2016 spelled his end. After doing his"
41,66.67,36.05,"business in a Walgreens restroom, staff were appalled to find the stall looking like an explosion at the chocolate factory. Staff"
42,66.42,34.97,called him back to the scene of the crime and demanded – very publicly – that he clean up his awful
43,65.54,32.07,"mess. He eventually obliged, but the sheer embarrassment took its toll. According to his widow, the emotional distress of the incident"
44,64.6,29.59,"was responsible for the man’s death soon afterwards and she filed a lawsuit against Walgreens on this basis. Indeed, distress can"
45,64.22,29.73,"cause cardiac arrest in extreme cases, and if there was ever a legit reason to die of embarrassment, it’d be this"
46,64.24,32.0,"guy’s bathroom misadventure. It goes to show, if you must leave a mess in a public restroom, have a rapid escape"
47,66.4,33.48,"plan prepared. Alternative Medicine Of all the things to be sceptical of, the meticulously-tested, highly-regulated treatments of modern medicine are a"
48,64.12,32.09,"very poor choice. While mistrust of certain scientific methods of treatment is often a problem of ignorance and misinformation, it can"
49,63.91,28.51,prove a fatal error of judgement when the only alternative is death. Case in point: after being diagnosed with breast cancer
50,63.84,24.65,"in 2016, a British mother decided against conventional treatments like chemotherapy and surgery. She decided that natural remedies, like raw turmeric,"
51,63.21,21.68,"iodine-rich brown seaweed and a vegan diet would be a much better treatment plan. Unsurprisingly, she died in 2019 after the"
52,62.82,19.61,cancer spread throughout her body. It was a heart-breaking story of wilful ignorance that left a child motherless. There’s nothing funny
53,62.45,18.26,"about this one, folks; it’s simply a reminder that science exists for very good reasons, which become clear when people choose"
54,62.21,17.5,"to ignore it. Just Plane Stupid I’m no aviation expert, but I’d say if you’re up in the air and fuel"
55,62.19,17.04,"begins to slosh around your feet in the cockpit, you probably have a problem. Unfortunately, one pilot refused to take that"
56,62.11,16.46,"specific problem seriously, despite the insistence of airport mechanics after he touched down to refuel on a one-man cross-country flight in"
57,61.61,15.47,"2015. Before the appalled mechanics at Missoula International Airport had a chance to intervene, the Bucker Jungmeister aircraft was back on"
58,61.12,14.06,the runway. The pilot insisted that he was in too much of a hurry to carry out repairs and headed straight
59,60.78,12.58,onto the next leg of his journey. But the plane would reach its final destination even sooner than expected. 10 seconds
60,60.57,11.58,"after take-off, the plane came crashing back down and exploded in a ball of flames. It only takes a glance at"
61,60.45,11.48,the wreckage to be able to guess whether or not the hasty pilot survived. Spoiler: he didn’t. One In The Chamber
62,60.49,12.28,"When it comes to irresponsible behaviour, anything relating to guns lands at the top of the idiot list. But the level"
63,60.65,13.69,"of stupidity in this story will blow your mind. While enjoying a few beers in Brevard County, Florida, a man and"
64,60.31,15.68,"his friend began playing around with a handgun. After removing the magazine from the gun, the owner wanted to be extra"
65,59.92,18.56,"safe and make sure there wasn’t still a bullet in the chamber. After all, you never can be too careful. To"
66,59.72,22.24,"test this, he jokingly held the gun up to his temple, presumably certain he’d already unloaded it. In light-hearted jest he"
67,59.48,25.47,"pulled the trigger. With a bang, the party was over. The bright spark was dead by the time police arrived on-scene."
68,61.51,26.24,"If there was ever a poster child for gun safety, it’d be this guy. Off-Roading In 2018, a Florida woman learned"
69,58.04,23.7,"the hard way that trains don’t play fair in a race. While the guard rails were down at a newly-built crossing,"
70,57.92,19.17,"the lady made a serious error of judgement, deciding she could cross the tracks before the train reached her. But, as"
71,57.53,15.14,"you probably guessed, guard rails are there for a reason; that reason being, if you cross while they’re down, you’re probably"
72,57.13,13.27,"going to die. And that’s exactly what happened. The woman and her bike met their end with the train, right on"
73,57.04,13.78,"schedule. A Royal Romance Young love is a powerful thing, and if the case of King Louis III of France is"
74,56.97,16.03,"anything to go by, even royals aren’t safe from its dangerous snares. In 882C.E., at the lustful age of 18, Louis"
75,57.12,18.9,"fell for a girl in Saint-Denis on the outskirts of Paris. One day, he spotted her making her way through town,"
76,57.23,21.22,"and mounted his horse to pursue her. But, with his attention totally fixed upon his love interest, he failed to spot"
77,57.12,22.15,"the low-hanging lintel of a doorway ahead of him. Moving at speed, he crashed head-first into the frame and fell, fatally"
78,56.98,21.47,"fracturing his skull. He died soon afterwards, proving once and for all that love… hurts. Unforgettable Entrance After kicking her boyfriend"
79,56.61,19.76,"out of her house in November 2007, a Florida woman hadn’t hoped to see him on the premises again for a"
80,56.5,18.36,"while. But after leaving the house for a few hours and returning, the woman was shocked to see her boyfriend again"
81,55.71,18.77,"so soon. Only, he wasn’t pleading with her to let him back in; it seemed he’d made the decision to enter"
82,55.45,21.55,"the house by any means necessary… and failed. You see, he’d tried to enter through the cat flap, presumably hoping to"
83,55.48,25.27,"unlock the door. He’d delved in, got one arm through followed by his head, and gotten stuck. In this embarrassing position,"
84,56.77,27.44,"he’d died, presumably from asphyxiation, although stupidity hasn’t been ruled out as the main cause of death. One Last Trick It’s"
85,56.32,26.6,"pretty obvious that, without the right amount of practice and preparation, attempting death-defying stunts can be incredibly stupid and dangerous. For"
86,55.79,23.14,"an Indian escape artist by the name of Chanchal Lahiri, an attempt to emulate the great masters like Harry Houdini ended"
87,55.64,18.56,"in disaster in 2019. Lahiri was lowered into the strong currents of the Hooghly River near Howrah, India, with his hand"
88,55.5,14.33,"and feet tied. He was expected to escape and resurface soon after, but onlookers grew concerned after 15 minutes with no"
89,55.39,11.19,"sign of the illusionist. He wouldn’t resurface until much later, when police pulled his lifeless body from the river. Officials stated"
90,55.81,9.01,"that Lahiri’s cumbersome outfit, combined with the strong currents of the river, made an escape nearly impossible. Without the necessary preparations,"
91,55.75,7.01,"Lahiri seemed to have grossly underestimated the difficulty of the stunt and fell victim to his own ego. Really, though, if"
92,55.18,4.46,"being tied up and thrown into a river seems like anything other than a bad idea, then... [roll clip] Cut Of"
93,54.6,1.13,"The Cash Hurting yourself as an insurance scam is never clever, but an Italian man achieved maximum stupidity in 2001 with"
94,53.89,-2.69,"what may be the dumbest money-making scheme of all time. After taking out several policies with different insurance companies, the man"
95,53.31,-6.05,had asked his cousin to cut his leg off with a chainsaw. He’d hoped to cash in for over half a
96,52.77,-6.94,"million dollars on the injury with claims of being permanently disabled by the so-called ‘accident’. But, while the DIY amputation was"
97,51.88,-3.79,"being performed, extreme blood loss set in, and the would-be fraudster died from his gruesome injuries. His cousin, fittingly, was arrested"
