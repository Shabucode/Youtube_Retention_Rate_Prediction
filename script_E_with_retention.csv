5,81.2,E,Leap of Faith In May of 2019 a car chase left a criminal in a tough spot. The Brooklyn,32.7
6,80.44,E,"man was wanted for a carjacking when he made his first dumb move: crashing into a police car, triggering",39.24
7,79.35,E,"a high-speed chase. His second – and most lasting – mistake came later, after the pursuit left him trapped",45.78

12,78.23,E,falling victim to the wrath of a root vegetable has to be near the top. When out on a,78.48
13,78.13,E,"hunting trip in 1881, British politician Sir William Payne-Gallwey entered the annals of ridiculous history, when he slipped and",85.02

31,69.32,E,"bee, their chances of suffering an allergic reaction increase. But for one woman who was unaware of this fact,",202.74
32,68.73,E,"her reaction came as a total surprise, after having the treatment so many times. The woman immediately lost consciousness",209.28

37,67.41,E,if I were to say it. A musical career dedicated to causing as much controversy as possible culminated in,241.98
38,67.2,E,"a rather unclimactic end, when he attempted to ride his way along the rail of an escalator. He lost",248.52

43,65.25,E,"the evidence together, police concluded that the couple had been sat atop a 100ft wall overlooking the beach, when",281.22

45,64.77,E,"landed on a ledge just below them. Unfortunately, they both lost their balance, and plunged the full distance to",294.3

54,61.75,E,"Everybody loves the hearty goodness of a home-cooked meal, assuming at least one person in the house can cook.",353.16
55,61.49,E,But renowned mathematician Kurt Gödel took his love of his wife’s home cooking to ridiculous levels. Despite – or,359.7
56,63.43,E,"perhaps because of – his brilliance as a mathematician, Gödel was an extremely paranoid man. His paranoia grew to",366.24
57,60.61,E,"the point where, in his later years, he refused to eat anything that hadn’t first been tasted or prepared",372.78000000000003
58,60.11,E,"by his wife. Believing himself to be at the centre of a poisoning plot, when his wife was hospitalised",379.32
59,59.97,E,"for six weeks in 1977 and hence was unable to cook for her husband, Gödel stopped eating. By the",385.86
60,59.39,E,"end of January 1978, he had died of malnutrition - weighing only 65 pounds when he died. In the",392.4
61,58.78,E,"end, through his desperation to avoid being murdered, he was the one responsible for his own death. It really",398.94

63,58.21,E,"are caused by no eating at all, occasionally someone will kick the bucket because of the total opposite. In",412.02
64,57.81,E,"this case, the bucket was filled to the brim with sticky, delicious sweet rolls. Adolf Frederick, King of Sweden",418.56
65,57.44,E,"from 1751 to 1771, wasn’t a particularly good king. He was regarded as lacking the aptitude, fortitude and integrity",425.1
66,57.32,E,"necessary to successful kingship. But what he lacked as a king, he made up for in appetite. He was",431.64
67,57.31,E,"a lover of food, with a sweet tooth, and it could never be said that his eyes were bigger",438.18
68,57.16,E,than his belly. But while the amount of food he consumed on his last meal in February 1771 did,444.72
69,56.96,E,"exceed the limitations of his large belly, he finished it nonetheless. After a heaping feast of seafood, sauerkraut and",451.26
70,56.92,E,"champagne, he moved on to dessert. This consisted of no less than 14 Swedish sweet rolls, all dipped in",457.8
71,56.41,E,"hot milk flavoured with cinnamon and raisins. While he was reportedly stockpiling for the Christian tradition of Lent, he",464.34
72,56.09,E,"clearly overshot his mark, as his digestive system completely shut down and he died. It just goes to show:",470.88
73,55.97,E,death by cake isn’t as sweet as it sounds. A Cut Above The Vest Nobody wants to be conned,477.42
74,55.64,E,"when making a purchase. Indeed, being sold a stab-proof vest that offers the protection of a wet noodle is",483.96
75,55.41,E,hardly an ideal scenario. But it should go without saying that testing the stab-ability of such a vest should,490.5
76,55.13,E,"be done with at least one qualifying factor: taking the vest off first. Unfortunately, that first rule of stab",497.04

80,53.91,E,"get to the dumbest death magnets of the bunch, let’s take a look at some contenders who somehow managed",523.2
81,54.04,E,"to avoid qualifying for a Darwin award by surviving their stupidity. This electrician clearly trained with the best, because",529.74

84,52.25,E,great mix – but the rubber industry doesn’t want you to know that! For any Darwin Award nominees watching,549.36
85,52.19,E,"– that was a joke. Anyway, this next close contender seems to be pulling a prank with a fuel-depleted",555.9
86,51.87,E,chainsaw held alarmingly close to his nether region. But the risk-to-reward ratio of this particular prank earns this guy,562.44
87,51.63,E,"a firm position in the at-risk Darwin award survivors club. That’s just no place for a chainsaw, joke or",568.98
88,51.18,E,not. The final at-risk survivor is this fellow who let rage overcome any shred of rational thought. While his,575.52

91,50.31,E,"he accidentally opens his door, and tumbles gracefully onto the highway. Hey, at least he stuck the landing! Though,",595.14
92,50.23,E,"if this is his reaction to a bit of road rage, I feel like his Darwin award isn’t too",601.68
93,50.08,E,"far away over the horizon. A Bridge Too Far Videogames, movies and TV shows have led us all to",608.22
94,49.91,E,believe that clearing a rising drawbridge in a car is a viable feat. It isn’t. But that realisation never,614.76
95,49.54,E,occurred to a couple of wannabe Texan stuntmen who put their inflated senses of their own abilities to the,621.3
96,49.17,E,test in May 2019. Witnesses reported seeing a car’s passenger lift the barrier of the Black Bayou drawbridge in,627.84
97,48.17,E,"Louisiana, before the car sped off up the rising ramp. Now, admittedly, some people do occasionally survive these jumps,",634.38

99,18.16,E,"to the other side. But these people are the minority and shouldn’t be taken as representative of the majority. Because the majority, like our Texan friends, follow a learning curve that’s steeper than the downward path of their car. However, any learning was short-lived in this case, as the Texan pair were trapped in their car after it failed to make the jump to the other side. They sank and soon drowned. Put simply, they were neither fast, nor furious enough. Which Darwin award winner do you think was the stupidest? Do you know of any more ridiculously dumb ways people died?
